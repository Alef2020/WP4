This is used for all calculations on WP4 for the MERCY mission. Please follow the variable definition convention and add comments to your code.

It does not matter what editor you use for your code, GitHub only cares about the final Python file. I use IDLE because it is what I am used to but feel free to use anything else.




Instructions to use my dogshit (Lug):


Using the table below specify which graphe you want to use for curve_Kt, write it as "Curve 1" as example.


![Kt curve](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b7637c4-c117-4159-b0df-cf5466cd0ef4)

This table is to specify curve_Kty, write it in the same manner as shown above. 
Note: Curve 3 is for yield for all materials and geometries and should be treated as the standard, the other curves are for ultimate calculations
